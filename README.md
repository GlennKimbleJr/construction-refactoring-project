# Construct Database | A Refactoring Story...

I thought it would be fun to take an old project and go through the process of refactoring it. 

So I picked one of the fist projects I ever did, a simple script for my dad's construction company. It was designed to help track projects that had been sent out to sub-contractors for bid. This is a slightly modified version of the original codebase, as I needed to remove any private information. I felt it important to leave it as untouched as possible, to show just how bad it was. 

I wanted to take this old piece of junk, and step by step turn it into something respectable. Along the way I hope to learn a thing or two.
